This project is part of 3 project series by Brad Traversy where I  learnt basic concepts of React including how to create a Flux pattern using the Context API with the useContext and useReducer hooks. 

The project invloved are  built as full stack MERN application with a custom Express backend API that uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication. 

Some of the Highlights of what I learnt creating this project:

React Fundamentals (Components, props, state, etc)

Using tools like Node.JS, VS Code, Git, Github, React Dev Tools, Reduc Dev Tools, Postman to test API endpoints

VS Code Extensions used :ES7 React/Redux Code Snippets, Bracket pair Colorizer, Prettier, AutoRename Tag
React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useRef) 

Started off by Coding the app with Class based components and later Refactor the code to transition over to Funcitonal components by implementing Reacts Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useRef)

Context API & App Level State

MERN - MongoDB, Express React, Node

Build a Custom API With JWT Authentication

Redux - Reducers, Actions, etc
